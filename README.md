### Deep Learning Specialization

[deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/), COURSERA

The project was done using the concepts that I learned from this course. The deep learning specialization covers five course that are Neural network, Improving hyperparameters, Structuring ML projects, Convolutional neural network and Sequence models. All the course are delivered by professor Andrew NG. The course was made available online in 2017 and it has many assignments and quizes to solve for hands on practice on the topics. The certificate for the course can be found [here](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/N5YHFRBYDX8W).
